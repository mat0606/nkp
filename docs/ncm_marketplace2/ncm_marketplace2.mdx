# Publishing Blueprints from Marketplace Manager

By default, NCM Self Service comes pre-seeded with validated Blueprints for multiple open source and enterprise applications. Marketplace Manager acts as a
staging area for publishing default and user-created Blueprints to your local Marketplace. The Marketplace acts as an application store,
providing end users with a catalog of available applications.
